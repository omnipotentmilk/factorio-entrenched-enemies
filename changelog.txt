Version: 1.0.0
Date: 13.11.2024
  Info:
    - This initial release aims to make enemy bases harder to destroy thus making expansions are more difficult activity without requiring the entire map being a red mist
    - A primary goal is make killing individual bases feel like an achievement rather than running over hundreds of them with ease ( relative player power vs evolution )
    - A secondary goal is to ocasionally throw a curve ball when you see quality stompers bases or worms which pose hightened risk.
  Features:
    - Worms / unit spawners when created on chunk create or expansion party can possibly be created as a quality entity. Default chance 20% to level up, when a level up occurs it is rolled again, allowing any quality to possibly appear, default is 20% ( configurable )
    - Worms / unit spawners now have scalable max HP, default is 3x normal ( configurable )
    - Worms / unit spawners now have scalable hp regen, default is 3x ( configurable )
    - Unit spawner's spawn rate for new enemies is now scalable, this is noticable when you approach a base and the enemies agro onto you how long it takes for new enemies to spawn at the base replacing the ones chasing you, default 2x speed ( Configurable )
